The goal of colby.gg is to document the things I find interesting. This includes my HomeLab setup, software practices, and other bits and pieces that may be useful to reference in the future.

Hopefully someday colby.gg will become a useful reference.

## Tech Stack

Site generation is done using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)

Hosting service is currently [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) with a custom domain

Deployment is done via [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions)

## Steps

0. Create a github repository with a name matching:

    `${GITHUB_USERNAME}.github.io`

    If your github username is SillyWilly, then he repository name must be `SillyWilly.github.io`.

1. Install Hugo locally

    Hugo has fairly good [installation](https://gohugo.io/installation/) and [quick start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) instructions.

    For WSL environments I found downloading the latest release and placing the hugo binary at `/usr/local/bin/hugo` worked best.

     **Make sure to download the extended version**

    The extended version is more likely to work with any themes you choose. The commands below should work for WSL or plain linux.

    ```bash
    cd /path/to/Downloads
    tar -xvf hugo_extended_0.119.0_Linux-64bit.tar.gz
    sudo mv hugo /usr/local/bin/
    ```

2. Follow the Hugo [quick start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/) instructions.

    Example init command:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MrUsefull/MrUsefull.github.io
    hugo new site MrUsefull.github.io --force
    ```

    The above snippet is the only deviation I took from the Hugo docs.

3. After completing the quick start instructions, running `hugo` should create the public directory. For this setup, do not commit public directory. Commit all other files and push to your github repository.

4. Create the github action. Once again Hugo has great [documentation](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) for this. Quick warning: Double check the branch in the github actions yaml is the default branch you use. The documentation's example uses `main`.

    Once the github action changes are pushed to the default branch, your site should be available at `${GITHUB_USERNAME}.github.io`

5. Use the project settings page to set the custom domain to the domain or subdomain you already own.

    You probably also want to [verify](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/verifying-your-custom-domain-for-github-pages) your domain.

    Github's [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/configuring-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site/managing-a-custom-domain-for-your-github-pages-site) differ between subdomains (foo.example.com) and apex domains (example.com).

6. Write this post!

## Troubleshooting

When using Cloudflare for DNS on a custom domain, github pages gives the following error:

```error
The page isnâ€™t redirecting properly
```

The solution is to disable cloudflare proxy for the domain or subdomain pointing at github pages.
