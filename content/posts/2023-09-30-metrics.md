Getting monitoring up and running with Prometheus and Grafana deployed in a kubernetes cluster is surprisingly easy.

## Tech Stack

### Pre-requisites

These must already be installed and configured:

- [K3S cluster](https://k3s.io/) or any kubernetes cluster. This is just what I use.
- [helm](https://helm.sh/) handles deployments.
- [cert-manager](https://cert-manager.io/) gets our certificates.

### To be Configured

- [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/), installed with the prometheus-community [helm chart](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/prometheus).
- [Grafana](https://grafana.com/), installed with the Grafana [helm chart](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/tree/main/charts/grafana).

## Install

### Create a new git repository for monitoring

This assumes the repository has been created as an empty repo:

```bash
cd monitoring/
git init
touch README.md # Don't forget to document your stuff so you know what you've done!
mkdir prometheus
mkdir grafana
```

### Install Prometheus

1. Create a new file in the monitoring repo called `values.yml`.
2. Add the unedited contents of the Prometheus [default values](https://github.com/prometheus-community/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/prometheus/values.yaml).
3. Modify values.yml to match your needs.

    These are some of the changes I've made to the default values. Most places insist on exposing the WebUI with kubectl port forwarding. This seems silly for just testing that the install came up. I chose to expose it through an ingress with tls certs. After verifying things look good, I disabled the ingress.

    Ingress is disabled because actual interactions with Prometheus will be done via Grafana for display and config alterations for metrics scraping.

    Modified ingress section of values.yml, with commented out sections removed for brevity:

    ```yaml
    ingress:
        ## If true, Prometheus server Ingress will be created
        ##
        enabled: false # IMPORTANT: set to true to enable access via prometheus.domain_name.here # <---- CHANGED 
    
        annotations: # These annotations are assuming K3S and cert-manager setup specifics <---- CHANGED
          traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/router.entrypoints: websecure # <---- CHANGED
          traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/router.tls: "true" # <---- CHANGED
          cert-manager.io/issuer: letsencrypt-prod # letsencrypt-prod is the issuer I have configured, may be different in other environments  # <---- CHANGED
    
        ## Prometheus server Ingress additional labels
        ##
        extraLabels: {}
    
        ## Prometheus server Ingress hostnames with optional path
        ## Must be provided if Ingress is enabled
        ##
        hosts:
          - prometheus.domain_name.here # IMPORTANT: hostname setup # <---- CHANGED 
    
        path: /
    
        pathType: Prefix
    
        extraPaths: []
    
        ## Prometheus server Ingress TLS configuration
        ## 
        ## The default values file comment is a lie if you have cert-manager. Certs will be created automatically.
        ##
        tls:
        - secretName: prometheus-server-tls
          hosts:
          - prometheus.domain_name.here # IMPORTANT: set the hostname for cert-manager to create certs # <---- CHANGED 
    ```

    Setting `enabled: true` in the above modifications will create an ingress and certificates automatically, allowing access to Prometheus at `https://prometheus.domain_name.here`. Assuming DNS is configured of course.

4. Get the helm chart.

    ```bash
    helm repo add prometheus-community https://prometheus-community.github.io/helm-charts
    helm repo update
    ```

5. Install - from the `prometheus` directory we've been working in.

    ```bash
    helm install prometheus prometheus-community/prometheus -f values.yml
    ```

6. Note down the value of `scrape_interval` in values.yml

  ```bash
  server:
    < Lots of stuff left off >
    global:
      ## How frequently to scrape targets by default
      ##
      scrape_interval: 1m # <--- this is important for grafana
  ```

  That's all there is to it. Prometheus is installed and running. If the ingress above is enabled and DNS is configured, you should be able to poke around on `https://prometheus.domain_name.here`

## Install Grafana

1. Make a `grafana` directory in your monitoring repo.
2. Add the unedited contents of the Grafana [default values](https://github.com/grafana/helm-charts/blob/main/charts/grafana/values.yaml).
3. Modify values.yml to match your needs.

    These are some of the changes I've made for my environment:

    Ingress section

    ```yaml
    ingress:
      enabled: true
      annotations:
          traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/router.entrypoints: websecure # <-- changed
          traefik.ingress.kubernetes.io/router.tls: "true" # <-- changed
          cert-manager.io/issuer: letsencrypt-prod # <-- changed, allows cert-manager to get my certs
      labels: {}
      path: /

      # pathType is only for k8s >= 1.1=
      pathType: Prefix

      hosts:
        - grafana.domain_name.here # <-- changed
      ## Extra paths to prepend to every host configuration. This is useful when working with annotation based services.
      extraPaths: []

      tls: 
        - secretName: chart-example-tls
          hosts:
            - grafana.domain_name.here # <-- changed
    ```

    Persistence section, necessary to enable storage access to keep the data and configs.

    ```yaml
    ## Enable persistence using Persistent Volume Claims
    ## ref: http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/persistent-volumes/
    ##
    persistence:
      type: pvc
      enabled: true # <-- changed. Enables storage
      # storageClassName: default
      accessModes:
        - ReadWriteOnce
      size: 10Gi
      # annotations: {}
      finalizers:
        - kubernetes.io/pvc-protection
      extraPvcLabels: {}
    
      inMemory:
        enabled: false
    ```

4. Get the helm chart.

    ```bash
    helm repo add grafana https://grafana.github.io/helm-charts
    helm repo update
    ```

5. Install - from the `grafana` directory we've been working in.

    ```bash
    helm install grafana grafana/grafana -f values.yml
    ```

    Output should include instructions to get your initial admin password. Don't forget to change this in the WebUI!

6. Assuming DNS is configured, Grafana should now be reachable at `https://grafana.domain_name.here`
7. Get your prometheus internal to the cluster IP - you'll need this to setup Grafana.

    ```bash
    # kubectl get service | grep prometheus-server
        prometheus-server                     ClusterIP   10.43.198.203   <none>        80/TCP                                3h21m
    ```

    In this case, I needed to note down 10.43.198.203 as the Prometheus IP address. When you add your Prometheus data source, use this IP.

NOTE: Scrape interval in Grafana must match the configured Prometheus scrape interval
